## Slide 20

GALUP phase-2 has just been awarded by NASA, which will run from
2023 to the end of 2025.
Our proposal is integrating socio-economic and remotely sensed information
to characterize conflict precursors and land degradation dynamics.

As I mentioned before, the two activites aggrevating land degradation in Ghana
are charcoal production and galamsey or illegal gold mining.
But, with the knowledge we have learned from last project, we found these
activities due to their small scale operation are usually hard
to monitor and dectect by remote sensing through satellites.
Therefore, we propose to use Unmanned Aerial Systems (a.k.a. UAS) or drones
to monitor these activities and use AI to perform object detection using the
collected data.
We will train our Ghanian Collaborator CERSGIS, or center for remote
sensing and Geographic information services to assemble the UAS and automate
the detection process using open-source software.

## Slide 21

One of the biggest problems with devising effective policy recommendations
is a lack of socioeconomic data at fine-grained spatial scales.
The issue is not only a problem in Ghana but very common in many western
african countries.
Socio-economic data in these countries are only available at large scales
for example at district level, which makes it practically not usable
for land use planning purposes.
We propose to use a deep learning algorithm that is developed by one of the
GALUP team members to downscale these data by combining census
data that are at micro-scale with proxies derived from data on Google
Earth Engine.
This algorithm has been tested through another NASA-funded project using
data from India.

## Slide 22

The third objective is to deploy the LUCIS model to a web-based portal and
include the downscaled socioeconomic data to provide an easy-to-use land
use modeling framework to all stakeholders and interest groups to enable
decision making in a democratized manner.
